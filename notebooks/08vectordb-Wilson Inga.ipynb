It really does.  \\\"[Atoms] aren't even real.\\\"\\n\\n: Tell me then, those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are\\n: atoms now, so what are they?  Figments of our imaginations?  The\\n: evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming, but I won't bother with\\n: most evidence at the moment.\\n\\nYou would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are\\nactaully there - as perceived? This may be interesting. I thought\\nthat an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of \\\"light\\\"\\ncan illuminate any \\\"object\\\" of atomic scale. If this image is to have\\nuseful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have\\nto be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?\\n\\nIf an atom is a \\\"probablity cloud\\\", lower resolutions would give the\\nappearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is\\nnot an object is any conventional sense. Obviously I am not a\\nphysicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic\\nnature. Anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...\",\n          \"\\n\\nThat's a good way to put it.  It's a quiet confidence.  I don't feel like\\nI have to defend this team anymore. \\n\\nThe Devils are a puzzle to me.  They have long been one of the few teams\\nI always dreaded playing.  Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they\\nstill usually play us pretty tough.  I just can't figure it out.  At least\\nlast night they mounted an attack.\\n\\n\\nBernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news.  He was\\nshaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like\\nanother defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.\\nThen he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing\\noff and he said, \\\"It just isn't right...it just isn't fair...\\\" and he\\ntried to muster a smile.\\n\\n\\nAs far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good.\\n\\nOne guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri.  I'm sure\\nTom Barrasso knows how he feels.  For so long Tommy would look up and not\\nhave a teammate in sight.

This may be interesting. I thought\\nthat an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of \\\"light\\\"\\ncan illuminate any \\\"object\\\" of atomic scale. If this image is to have\\nuseful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have\\nto be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?\\n\\nIf an atom is a \\\"probablity cloud\\\", lower resolutions would give the\\nappearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is\\nnot an object is any conventional sense.
