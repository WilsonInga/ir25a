In this simple example, we may\\ndirectly calculate this steady-state probability distribution by observing the\\nsymmetry of the Markov chain: states 1 and 3 are symmetric, as evident from\\nthe fact that the \\ufb01rst and third rows of the transition probability matrix in\\nEquation (21.3) are identical. Postulating, then, that they both have the same\\nsteady-state probability and denoting this probability by p, we know that the\\nsteady-state distribution is of the form \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (p 1 \\u22122p p). Now, using the\\nidentity \\u20d7\\u03c0 = \\u20d7\\u03c0P, we solve a simple linear equation to obtain p = 5/18 and\\nconsequently, \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (5/18 4/9 5/18).\\nThe PageRank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them)\\nare independent of any query a user might pose; PageRank is thus a query-\\nindependent measure of the static quality of each web page (recall such static\\nquality measures from Section 7.1.4). On the other hand, the relative order-\\ning of pages should, intuitively, depend on the query being served. For this\\nreason, search engines use static quality measures such as PageRank as just\\none of many factors in scoring a web page on a query. Indeed, the relative\\ncontribution of PageRank to the overall score may again be determined by\\nmachine-learned scoring as in Section 15.4.1.\",\n          \"19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\n437\\n2. Picking from the top 100 results of E1 induces a bias from the ranking\\nalgorithm of E1. Picking from all the results of E1 makes the experiment\\nslower. This is particularly so because most web search engines put up\\ndefenses against excessive robotic querying.\\n3. During the checking phase, a number of additional biases are introduced:\\nfor instance, E2 may not handle 8-word conjunctive queries properly.\\n4. Either E1 or E2 may refuse to respond to the test queries, treating them as\\nrobotic spam rather than as bona \\ufb01de queries.\\n5. There could be operational problems like connection time-outs.\\nA sequence of research has built on this basic paradigm to eliminate some\\nof these issues; there is no perfect solution yet, but the level of sophistica-\\ntion in statistics for understanding the biases is increasing. The main idea\\nis to address biases by estimating, for each document, the magnitude of the\\nbias. From this, standard statistical sampling methods can generate unbi-\\nased samples. In the checking phase, the newer work moves away from\\nconjunctive queries to phrase and other queries that appear to be better-\\nbehaved. Finally, newer experiments use other sampling methods besides\\nrandom queries. The best known of these is document random walk sampling,\\nin which a document is chosen by a random walk on a virtual graph de-\\nrived from documents. In this graph, nodes are documents; two documents\\nare connected by an edge if they share two or more words in common. The\\ngraph is never instantiated; rather, a random walk on it can be performed by\\nmoving from a document d to another by picking a pair of keywords in d,\\nrunning a query on a search engine and picking a random document from\\nthe results. Details may be found in the references in Section 19.7.\\n?\\nExercise 19.7\\nTwo web search engines A and B each generate a large number of pages uniformly at\\nrandom from their indexes. 30% of A\\u2019s pages are present in B\\u2019s index, while 50% of\\nB\\u2019s pages are present in A\\u2019s index. What is the number of pages in A\\u2019s index relative\\nto B\\u2019s?\\n19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\nOne aspect we have ignored in the discussion of index size in Section 19.5 is\\nduplication: the Web contains multiple copies of the same content. By some\\nestimates, as many as 40% of the pages on the Web are duplicates of other\\npages. Many of these are legitimate copies; for instance, certain information\\nrepositories are mirrored simply to provide redundancy and access reliabil-\\nity. Search engines try to avoid indexing multiple copies of the same content,\\nto keep down storage and processing overheads.\",\n          \"388\\n17\\nHierarchical clustering\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9 10\\n0\\n1\\n\\u00d7\\nd1\\n\\u00d7\\nd2\\n\\u00d7\\nd3\\n\\u00d7\\nd4\\n\\u25eeFigure 17.10\\nComplete-link clustering is not best-merge persistent.

In a best-merge persistent algorithm like single-link, d3\\u2019s best-merge clus-\\nter would be {d1, d2}.\\nCan we also speed up the other three HAC algorithms with an NBM ar-\\nray? We cannot because only single-link clustering is best-merge persistent.\\nBEST-MERGE\\nPERSISTENCE\\nSuppose that the best merge cluster for \\u03c9k is \\u03c9j in single-link clustering.\\nThen after merging \\u03c9j with a third cluster \\u03c9i \\u0338= \\u03c9k, the merge of \\u03c9i and \\u03c9j\\nwill be \\u03c9k\\u2019s best merge cluster (Exercise 17.6). In other words, the best-merge\\ncandidate for the merged cluster is one of the two best-merge candidates of\\nits components in single-link clustering. This means that C can be updated\\nin \\u0398(N) in each iteration \\u2013 by taking a simple max of two values on line 14\\nin Figure 17.9 for each of the remaining \\u2264N clusters.\\nFigure 17.10 demonstrates that best-merge persistence does not hold for\\ncomplete-link clustering, which means that we cannot use an NBM array to\\nspeed up clustering. After merging d3\\u2019s best merge candidate d2 with cluster\\nd1, an unrelated cluster d4 becomes the best merge candidate for d3. This is\\nbecause the complete-link merge criterion is non-local and can be affected by\\npoints at a great distance from the area where two merge candidates meet.\\nIn practice, the ef\\ufb01ciency penalty of the \\u0398(N2 log N) algorithm is small\\ncompared with the \\u0398(N2) single-link algorithm since computing the similar-\\nity between two documents (e.g., as a dot product) is an order of magnitude\\nslower than comparing two scalars in sorting. All four HAC algorithms in\\nthis chapter are \\u0398(N2) with respect to similarity computations.

In this simple example, we may\\ndirectly calculate this steady-state probability distribution by observing the\\nsymmetry of the Markov chain: states 1 and 3 are symmetric, as evident from\\nthe fact that the \\ufb01rst and third rows of the transition probability matrix in\\nEquation (21.3) are identical. Postulating, then, that they both have the same\\nsteady-state probability and denoting this probability by p, we know that the\\nsteady-state distribution is of the form \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (p 1 \\u22122p p). Now, using the\\nidentity \\u20d7\\u03c0 = \\u20d7\\u03c0P, we solve a simple linear equation to obtain p = 5/18 and\\nconsequently, \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (5/18 4/9 5/18).\\nThe PageRank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them)\\nare independent of any query a user might pose; PageRank is thus a query-\\nindependent measure of the static quality of each web page (recall such static\\nquality measures from Section 7.1.4). On the other hand, the relative order-\\ning of pages should, intuitively, depend on the query being served. For this\\nreason, search engines use static quality measures such as PageRank as just\\none of many factors in scoring a web page on a query. Indeed, the relative\\ncontribution of PageRank to the overall score may again be determined by\\nmachine-learned scoring as in Section 15.4.1.\",\n          \"19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\n437\\n2. Picking from the top 100 results of E1 induces a bias from the ranking\\nalgorithm of E1. Picking from all the results of E1 makes the experiment\\nslower. This is particularly so because most web search engines put up\\ndefenses against excessive robotic querying.\\n3. During the checking phase, a number of additional biases are introduced:\\nfor instance, E2 may not handle 8-word conjunctive queries properly.\\n4. Either E1 or E2 may refuse to respond to the test queries, treating them as\\nrobotic spam rather than as bona \\ufb01de queries.\\n5. There could be operational problems like connection time-outs.\\nA sequence of research has built on this basic paradigm to eliminate some\\nof these issues; there is no perfect solution yet, but the level of sophistica-\\ntion in statistics for understanding the biases is increasing. The main idea\\nis to address biases by estimating, for each document, the magnitude of the\\nbias. From this, standard statistical sampling methods can generate unbi-\\nased samples. In the checking phase, the newer work moves away from\\nconjunctive queries to phrase and other queries that appear to be better-\\nbehaved. Finally, newer experiments use other sampling methods besides\\nrandom queries. The best known of these is document random walk sampling,\\nin which a document is chosen by a random walk on a virtual graph de-\\nrived from documents. In this graph, nodes are documents; two documents\\nare connected by an edge if they share two or more words in common. The\\ngraph is never instantiated; rather, a random walk on it can be performed by\\nmoving from a document d to another by picking a pair of keywords in d,\\nrunning a query on a search engine and picking a random document from\\nthe results. Details may be found in the references in Section 19.7.\\n?\\nExercise 19.7\\nTwo web search engines A and B each generate a large number of pages uniformly at\\nrandom from their indexes. 30% of A\\u2019s pages are present in B\\u2019s index, while 50% of\\nB\\u2019s pages are present in A\\u2019s index. What is the number of pages in A\\u2019s index relative\\nto B\\u2019s?\\n19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\nOne aspect we have ignored in the discussion of index size in Section 19.5 is\\nduplication: the Web contains multiple copies of the same content. By some\\nestimates, as many as 40% of the pages on the Web are duplicates of other\\npages. Many of these are legitimate copies; for instance, certain information\\nrepositories are mirrored simply to provide redundancy and access reliabil-\\nity. Search engines try to avoid indexing multiple copies of the same content,\\nto keep down storage and processing overheads.\",\n          \"388\\n17\\nHierarchical clustering\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9 10\\n0\\n1\\n\\u00d7\\nd1\\n\\u00d7\\nd2\\n\\u00d7\\nd3\\n\\u00d7\\nd4\\n\\u25eeFigure 17.10\\nComplete-link clustering is not best-merge persistent. At \\ufb01rst, d2 is\\nthe best-merge cluster for d3. But after merging d1 and d2, d4 becomes d3\\u2019s best-merge\\ncandidate. In a best-merge persistent algorithm like single-link, d3\\u2019s best-merge clus-\\nter would be {d1, d2}.\\nCan we also speed up the other three HAC algorithms with an NBM ar-\\nray? We cannot because only single-link clustering is best-merge persistent.\\nBEST-MERGE\\nPERSISTENCE\\nSuppose that the best merge cluster for \\u03c9k is \\u03c9j in single-link clustering.\\nThen after merging \\u03c9j with a third cluster \\u03c9i \\u0338= \\u03c9k, the merge of \\u03c9i and \\u03c9j\\nwill be \\u03c9k\\u2019s best merge cluster (Exercise 17.6). In other words, the best-merge\\ncandidate for the merged cluster is one of the two best-merge candidates of\\nits components in single-link clustering. This means that C can be updated\\nin \\u0398(N) in each iteration \\u2013 by taking a simple max of two values on line 14\\nin Figure 17.9 for each of the remaining \\u2264N clusters.\\nFigure 17.10 demonstrates that best-merge persistence does not hold for\\ncomplete-link clustering, which means that we cannot use an NBM array to\\nspeed up clustering. After merging d3\\u2019s best merge candidate d2 with cluster\\nd1, an unrelated cluster d4 becomes the best merge candidate for d3. This is\\nbecause the complete-link merge criterion is non-local and can be affected by\\npoints at a great distance from the area where two merge candidates meet.\\nIn practice, the ef\\ufb01ciency penalty of the \\u0398(N2 log N) algorithm is small\\ncompared with the \\u0398(N2) single-link algorithm since computing the similar-\\nity between two documents (e.g., as a dot product) is an order of magnitude\\nslower than comparing two scalars in sorting. All four HAC algorithms in\\nthis chapter are \\u0398(N2) with respect to similarity computations. So the differ-\\nence in complexity is rarely a concern in practice when choosing one of the\\nalgorithms.\\n?\\nExercise 17.1\\nShow that complete-link clustering creates the two-cluster clustering

In this simple example, we may\\ndirectly calculate this steady-state probability distribution by observing the\\nsymmetry of the Markov chain: states 1 and 3 are symmetric, as evident from\\nthe fact that the \\ufb01rst and third rows of the transition probability matrix in\\nEquation (21.3) are identical. Postulating, then, that they both have the same\\nsteady-state probability and denoting this probability by p, we know that the\\nsteady-state distribution is of the form \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (p 1 \\u22122p p). Now, using the\\nidentity \\u20d7\\u03c0 = \\u20d7\\u03c0P, we solve a simple linear equation to obtain p = 5/18 and\\nconsequently, \\u20d7\\u03c0 = (5/18 4/9 5/18).\\nThe PageRank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them)\\nare independent of any query a user might pose; PageRank is thus a query-\\nindependent measure of the static quality of each web page (recall such static\\nquality measures from Section 7.1.4). On the other hand, the relative order-\\ning of pages should, intuitively, depend on the query being served. For this\\nreason, search engines use static quality measures such as PageRank as just\\none of many factors in scoring a web page on a query. Indeed, the relative\\ncontribution of PageRank to the overall score may again be determined by\\nmachine-learned scoring as in Section 15.4.1.\",\n          \"19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\n437\\n2. Picking from the top 100 results of E1 induces a bias from the ranking\\nalgorithm of E1. Picking from all the results of E1 makes the experiment\\nslower. This is particularly so because most web search engines put up\\ndefenses against excessive robotic querying.\\n3. During the checking phase, a number of additional biases are introduced:\\nfor instance, E2 may not handle 8-word conjunctive queries properly.\\n4. Either E1 or E2 may refuse to respond to the test queries, treating them as\\nrobotic spam rather than as bona \\ufb01de queries.\\n5. There could be operational problems like connection time-outs.\\nA sequence of research has built on this basic paradigm to eliminate some\\nof these issues; there is no perfect solution yet, but the level of sophistica-\\ntion in statistics for understanding the biases is increasing. The main idea\\nis to address biases by estimating, for each document, the magnitude of the\\nbias. From this, standard statistical sampling methods can generate unbi-\\nased samples. In the checking phase, the newer work moves away from\\nconjunctive queries to phrase and other queries that appear to be better-\\nbehaved. Finally, newer experiments use other sampling methods besides\\nrandom queries. The best known of these is document random walk sampling,\\nin which a document is chosen by a random walk on a virtual graph de-\\nrived from documents. In this graph, nodes are documents; two documents\\nare connected by an edge if they share two or more words in common. The\\ngraph is never instantiated; rather, a random walk on it can be performed by\\nmoving from a document d to another by picking a pair of keywords in d,\\nrunning a query on a search engine and picking a random document from\\nthe results. Details may be found in the references in Section 19.7.\\n?\\nExercise 19.7\\nTwo web search engines A and B each generate a large number of pages uniformly at\\nrandom from their indexes. 30% of A\\u2019s pages are present in B\\u2019s index, while 50% of\\nB\\u2019s pages are present in A\\u2019s index. What is the number of pages in A\\u2019s index relative\\nto B\\u2019s?\\n19.6\\nNear-duplicates and shingling\\nOne aspect we have ignored in the discussion of index size in Section 19.5 is\\nduplication: the Web contains multiple copies of the same content. By some\\nestimates, as many as 40% of the pages on the Web are duplicates of other\\npages. Many of these are legitimate copies; for instance, certain information\\nrepositories are mirrored simply to provide redundancy and access reliabil-\\nity. Search engines try to avoid indexing multiple copies of the same content,\\nto keep down storage and processing overheads.\",\n          \"388\\n17\\nHierarchical clustering\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9 10\\n0\\n1\\n\\u00d7\\nd1\\n\\u00d7\\nd2\\n\\u00d7\\nd3\\n\\u00d7\\nd4\\n\\u25eeFigure 17.10\\nComplete-link clustering is not best-merge persistent. At \\ufb01rst, d2 is\\nthe best-merge cluster for d3. But after merging d1 and d2, d4 becomes d3\\u2019s best-merge\\ncandidate. In a best-merge persistent algorithm like single-link, d3\\u2019s best-merge clus-\\nter would be {d1, d2}.\\nCan we also speed up the other three HAC algorithms with an NBM ar-\\nray? We cannot because only single-link clustering is best-merge persistent.\\nBEST-MERGE\\nPERSISTENCE\\nSuppose that the best merge cluster for \\u03c9k is \\u03c9j in single-link clustering.\\nThen after merging \\u03c9j with a third cluster \\u03c9i \\u0338= \\u03c9k, the merge of \\u03c9i and \\u03c9j\\nwill be \\u03c9k\\u2019s best merge cluster (Exercise 17.6). In other words, the best-merge\\ncandidate for the merged cluster is one of the two best-merge candidates of\\nits components in single-link clustering. This means that C can be updated\\nin \\u0398(N) in each iteration \\u2013 by taking a simple max of two values on line 14\\nin Figure 17.9 for each of the remaining \\u2264N clusters.\\nFigure 17.10 demonstrates that best-merge persistence does not hold for\\ncomplete-link clustering, which means that we cannot use an NBM array to\\nspeed up clustering. After merging d3\\u2019s best merge candidate d2 with cluster\\nd1, an unrelated cluster d4 becomes the best merge candidate for d3. This is\\nbecause the complete-link merge criterion is non-local and can be affected by\\npoints at a great distance from the area where two merge candidates meet.\\nIn practice, the ef\\ufb01ciency penalty of the \\u0398(N2 log N) algorithm is small\\ncompared with the \\u0398(N2) single-link algorithm since computing the similar-\\nity between two documents (e.g., as a dot product) is an order of magnitude\\nslower than comparing two scalars in sorting.
